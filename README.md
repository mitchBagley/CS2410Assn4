Making a website so people can make their own recipes.


Project Requirements (in my own words): 
-Project must allow user to
    1. Add an ingredient to the recipe
    2. Remove an ingredient from a recipe
    3. Add an instruction to the recipe
    4. Remove an instruction to the recipe
    5. Move the recipe to a recipe card (using the writeRecipeToFile function)
    6. Allows user to do everything easily (in accessible way)
    7. Reset all of the fields to begin a new recipe

-What is accesibility? From Joseph Ditton
* Good color selection
* Keyboard interactivity
* Screenreader support - including live areas where appropriate.
* Good usage of the aria tags

NOTE: If you are on a Windows then you can use the built in Narrator app. You can activate narrator in your settings and if enabled the shortcut is "windows key + ctrl + enter".

Instructions: 
1. Already done

2. Build your application. You should keep accessibility in the front of your mind at all times!

3. Test your application by writing recipes and downloading them. The writeRecipeToFile just produces an HTML document that displays the recipe that you saved.

4. Submit the zip of your project
